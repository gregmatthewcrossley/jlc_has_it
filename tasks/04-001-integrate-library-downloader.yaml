title: Integrate library downloader (easyeda2kicad)
description: |
  Wrap the existing easyeda2kicad Python tool to download symbols, footprints,
  and 3D models from JLCPCB/EasyEDA for components by LCSC ID.

  This task integrates an existing, well-maintained tool rather than building
  from scratch. The tool handles:
  - Downloading component data from EasyEDA
  - Converting to KiCad format
  - Organizing output into symbol, footprint, and 3D model directories

dependencies:
  - 00-001

acceptance_criteria:
  - easyeda2kicad is declared as a dependency in pyproject.toml
  - Can call easyeda2kicad as subprocess or Python library
  - Returns path to downloaded library files
  - Handles errors gracefully (network issues, invalid LCSC ID, conversion failures)
  - Can download multiple components in parallel
  - Returns download status/results
  - Tests verify downloading works

estimated_complexity: medium
status: pending
notes: |
  easyeda2kicad is published on PyPI.
  Documentation: https://github.com/uPesy/easyeda2kicad.py
  Can use subprocess for CLI access or import as library.
  Consider parallelizing downloads for multiple components.
