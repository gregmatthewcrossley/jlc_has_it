title: Research JLCPCB API and data sources
description: |
  Investigate how to access JLCPCB component data. Document findings about
  available APIs, web scraping requirements, data formats, and rate limits.
dependencies:
  - 00-001
acceptance_criteria:
  - Document created (docs/jlcpcb-integration.md) with findings
  - API endpoints documented (if available)
  - Alternative scraping approach documented (if needed)
  - Sample response data captured and saved
  - Authentication requirements documented
  - Rate limits and usage policies documented
estimated_complexity: medium
status: pending
notes: |
  Check if JLCPCB has public API, otherwise may need web scraping.
  Look for existing Python libraries that do this.
