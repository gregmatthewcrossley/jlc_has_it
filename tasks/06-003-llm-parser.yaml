  DECISION: Use Claude API as primary parser (task 06-002), not as optional enhancement.

  Original plan had:
  - 06-002: Pattern-based parser (primary)
  - 06-003: LLM parser (optional enhancement)

  New plan:
  - 06-002: Claude API parser (primary and only)
  - No fallback parser for Phase 1

  Rationale:
  - User requested natural language interface
  - Claude API handles free-form queries better than regex
  - User already has Claude Code (likely has API access)
  - Simpler implementation (no need for two parsers)

  Future: Phase 2+ could add pattern-based fallback if API cost becomes issue.
