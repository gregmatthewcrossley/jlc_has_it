title: Add unit tests for Ultralibrarian detector and validator (12-001)
description: |
  Create comprehensive unit tests for the detector module (12-001).

  Tests should cover:
  - Directory detection (finding ul_* folders)
  - Folder structure validation (valid/invalid structures)
  - File discovery (symbol, footprint, 3D model files)
  - Edge cases (missing files, nested folders, special characters)
  - Cross-platform path handling

dependencies:
  - 12-001

acceptance_criteria:
  - Test file `tests/core/test_ultralibrarian_detector.py` created
  - At least 12 unit tests covering:
    - get_downloads_directory() on all platforms
    - find_ultralibrarian_folders() with mock folders
    - validate_folder_structure() with valid/invalid structures
    - extract_component_files() with complete/incomplete folders
    - Timeout behavior (max_age filtering)
    - Error handling (missing folders, no permissions, etc.)
  - All tests pass
  - Tests use fixtures for mock folder structures
  - Code coverage > 80% for detector module
  - Tests follow project conventions (pytest, mocking)

estimated_complexity: moderate
status: pending
notes: |
  Testing approach:
  - Use pytest fixtures to create temporary folders with expected structure
  - Mock pathlib and os.stat if needed for cross-platform testing
  - Use pytest.tmp_path for temporary directories
  - Test both complete and incomplete Ultralibrarian folders
  - Test with typical part numbers (simple and complex)
  - No real Downloads directory access needed
