title: Implement generic symbol generator
description: |
  Create fallback generator for basic KiCad symbols when library sources
  don't have the component (generic resistor, capacitor, IC symbols).
dependencies:
  - 02-004
acceptance_criteria:
  - GenericSymbolGenerator class created
  - Can generate generic symbols for common component types
  - Resistor, capacitor, inductor, diode, transistor templates
  - Generic IC symbol with configurable pin count
  - Generated symbols are valid and usable in KiCad
  - Tests verify generated symbols work
estimated_complexity: medium
status: pending
notes: |
  These are "good enough" placeholders.
  User can replace with specific symbol later.
  Focus on basic passive components and ICs.
