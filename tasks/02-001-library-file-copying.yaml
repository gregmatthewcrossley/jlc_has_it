title: Implement library file copying to KiCad projects
description: |
  Implement simple file copying functionality to add downloaded symbol files,
  footprints, and 3D models to KiCad project libraries.

  This replaces complex S-expression parsing with straightforward file operations:
  - Copy .kicad_sym files to project's symbol library
  - Copy .kicad_mod files to project's footprints.pretty/ directory
  - Copy .step/.wrl files to project's 3d_models/ directory
  - Create directories if needed
  - Update library tables if needed (or user does manually)

dependencies:
  - 00-001

acceptance_criteria:
  - Can copy symbol files to project directory
  - Can copy footprint files to project directory
  - Can copy 3D model files to project directory
  - Creates necessary directories if they don't exist
  - Handles errors gracefully (missing files, permission issues)
  - Function available for MCP tools to use
  - Basic tests for file operations

estimated_complexity: low
status: pending
notes: |
  This is a simple wrapper around shutil.copy().
  No need to parse or validate KiCad file contents.
  Library discovery can be manual or via easyeda2kicad output.
