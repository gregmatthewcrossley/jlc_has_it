title: Implement browser launch for Ultralibrarian part export
description: |
  Create a function that opens the user's default browser to the Ultralibrarian
  part details page, with clear instructions for exporting and downloading.

  This function should:
  - Take the Ultralibrarian part UUID (from search) as input
  - Open browser to https://app.ultralibrarian.com/details/<UUID>
  - Log clear step-by-step instructions for user
  - Return immediately (don't wait for download)

dependencies: []

acceptance_criteria:
  - Function `open_ultralibrarian_part(uuid: str, mpn: str) -> bool` created
  - Uses Python's built-in `webbrowser` module
  - Constructs correct URL: https://app.ultralibrarian.com/details/{uuid}
  - Opens browser and returns True on success
  - Prints clear instructions:
    1. Click "Export" button on the part page
    2. Select "KiCad v6+" format
    3. Select "3D Model (STEP)" format
    4. Wait for download button
    5. Click to download
  - Includes note about auto-unzipping behavior
  - Logs part information (MPN, UUID) for reference
  - Handles errors gracefully (no default browser, etc.)

estimated_complexity: simple
status: pending
notes: |
  Implementation notes:
  - Use webbrowser.open(url) - handles macOS, Windows, Linux
  - Instructions can be logged to console
  - Could also return instructions as string for MCP tool to format
  - UUID validation recommended (basic format check)
