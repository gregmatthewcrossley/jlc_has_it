acceptance_criteria:
  - pytest installed and configured in pyproject.toml
  - tests/ directory created with __init__.py
  - tests/conftest.py created with common fixtures
  - Sample test file demonstrates testing works
  - pytest runs successfully (even if no real tests yet)

  Will need fixtures for mocking JLCPCB responses later.
  Consider pytest-vcr for recording HTTP interactions.
