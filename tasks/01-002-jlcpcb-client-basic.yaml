description: |
  Create a client class to fetch component data from JLCPCB, based on
  research findings. Implement basic search functionality.
dependencies:
  - 01-001
acceptance_criteria:
  - JLCPCBClient class created in jlc_has_it/core/jlcpcb_client.py
  - search() method implemented
  - Returns structured component data (dataclass or dict)
  - Handles HTTP errors gracefully
  - Has basic tests with mocked responses
  - Respects rate limits (if applicable)
estimated_complexity: medium

  Use requests or httpx for HTTP client.
  Create Component dataclass for structured data.
  Mock responses in tests to avoid hitting live service.
