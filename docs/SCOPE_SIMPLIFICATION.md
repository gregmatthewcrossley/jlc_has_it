# Scope Simplification: Removing Complex KiCad File Handling

**Date**: October 2025
**Status**: Scope reduced from 29 tasks to 18 tasks

## What Changed

### Original Scope
The original project included Phase 2 with 6 tasks focused on **complex KiCad file parsing and generation**:
- S-expression parser implementation
- Symbol file reader/writer
- Footprint handler
- Project integration (library table updates, etc.)

This required deep understanding of KiCad's S-expression format and was complex, error-prone work.

### New Simplified Scope
Removed the complex file parsing layer. Instead:

**Phase 2: Library Integration (1 task - 02-001)**
- Simple file copying: copy already-downloaded files to project directories
- No parsing or validation needed
- Uses standard `shutil.copy()` operations

**Phase 4: Library Downloading (1 task - 04-001)**
- Wrap existing `easyeda2kicad` tool (well-maintained, published on PyPI)
- Don't reinvent library downloading
- Focus on integration, not implementation

## What This Means

### ✅ Benefits
1. **Dramatically reduced complexity** - 6 KiCad tasks → 1 file-copying task
2. **Reuse existing tools** - Leverage `easyeda2kicad` instead of reimplementing
3. **Faster implementation** - 2 simple tasks vs 6 complex ones
4. **Lower maintenance burden** - Fewer moving parts to maintain
5. **More time for other features** - CLI, search improvements, etc.

### ❌ Trade-offs
1. **No offline KiCad file generation** - Must use easyeda2kicad (which requires network)
2. **Library table updates manual** - Users may need to refresh in KiCad
3. **No custom symbol generation** - Users get what EasyEDA provides (usually sufficient)

## New Task Count

| Phase | Before | After | Status |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 0: Setup | 3 | 3 | ✅ Complete |
| 1: JLCPCB | 3 | 3 | ✅ Complete |
| 2: KiCad | 6 | 1 | ⏳ 1 remaining |
| 3: Search | 3 | 3 | ⏳ 3 remaining |
| 4: Libraries | 3 | 1 | ⏳ 1 remaining |
| 5: CLI | 5 | 5 | ⏳ 5 remaining (optional) |
| 6: NLP/MCP | 4 | 4 | ✅ Complete |
| 7: Performance | 2 | 2 | ✅ Complete |
| **Total** | **29** | **18** | **11 complete, 7 core remaining** |

## MVP Path (What's Left)

To reach a working MVP, complete these **7 tasks** (most critical first):

1. **02-001** (Library file copying) - 1-2 hours - Simple file operations
2. **04-001** (easyeda2kicad integration) - 2-4 hours - Wrap existing tool
3. **03-001** (Basic search) - 2-4 hours - Search without filters
4. **03-002** (Spec filtering) - 2-4 hours - Add filtering to search
5. **03-003** (Ranking) - 2-4 hours - Improve result ordering
6. **05-001** (CLI framework) - 1-2 hours - Optional, MCP is primary
7. **05-002** (Search command) - 2-4 hours - Optional CLI feature

**Estimated effort: 12-28 hours for core MVP**

## Already Complete (Don't Need to Implement)

✅ **Phase 6: Natural Language Processing (MCP Server)**
- Full MCP server with 4 tools
- Conversational interface ready
- Compatible with Claude Code/Desktop

✅ **Phase 7: Performance Optimization**
- FTS5 full-text search indexing (100-300x speedup)
- Pagination support for large result sets
- Both features fully tested and documented

## Current Capabilities

Right now, you can:
1. ✅ Search for components via MCP tools in Claude Code/Desktop
2. ✅ Get detailed specs for components
3. ✅ Compare multiple components
4. ✅ Fast searches with FTS5 indexing
5. ✅ Paginate through large result sets

What you cannot do yet:
- ❌ Automatically download component libraries
- ❌ Copy libraries to KiCad projects
- ❌ Filter search by detailed specifications
- ❌ Use CLI tool (use MCP tools via Claude instead)

## Next Priority

Start with **02-001 (Library file copying)** and **04-001 (Library downloader integration)** since they unlock the ability to add components to projects.

Then implement **03-001 (Basic search)** which likely already mostly works with the existing database layer.
